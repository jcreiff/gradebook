#Gradebook

Another App for Education

###What it does

Gradebook enables teachers to manage information about their classes efficiently
while ensuring that the information stays secure.  Users can login three different ways:

1. `Teacher`: Teachers act as admin users in Gradebook.  They have the ability to
create accounts for other teachers, and for any of their students and parents. Beyond
managing personal information, they can also keep track of student grades for their
class.

2. `Student`: Students have a more limited view of the Gradebook app.  They can
view a list of their grades, but do not have access to other students' grades or
personal information.

3. `Parent`: Parents have a similar scope as students.  Each parent can login and
track their own student's grades in a given class, but has no authorization to
make changes beyond their personal information.


(Also: Integration tests!)
